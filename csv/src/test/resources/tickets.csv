2,DataCleaner 1.5 Release,232,Memory consumption is too extensive in Value Distribution and Time Analysis,DataCleaner-core,None,enhancement,,new,2008-10-01T10:55:19Z+0200,2008-10-21T20:29:55Z+0200,"We should have a look at the Value Distribution and Time Analysis profiles. They consume very large amounts of memory because they basicly save all values in maps for analysis.

One way of improving this could be through caching. Another way could be through more appropriate (less verbose) storing of intermediate data (this looks obvious in Time Analysis profile). A third way could be by letting the profiles create queries themselves (related to metadata profiling, #222).",kasper

 * have an option to ignore repeating spaces (so {{{\"aaa aaaaa\" and \"aaa         aaaaa\"}}} are counted as one pattern. 
 * have an option to ignore case, and a different option to preserve case.
 * have an option to treat all 'special' characters as one pattern (so \"aaa*\", \"aaa/\", \"aaa\\" etc' are counted as one pattern, maybe denoted \"aaaS\").
 * have an option to treat all groups of characters as a single sub-pattern.  The idea is to be able to distinguish easily between names (say) that have two words and names that have more.

The metadata profile result should consist of suggestions for metadata changes. In the case above we would suggest incorporating certain relationships which the user can approve or deny.

 * Relations as lines between the boxes.
 * Tables that have no relations should be grouped in a box/outline titled \"tables without relations\".

Some ideas for how this graph could be used in the application:
 * When right clicking on a schema or a table it should be an option to bring up the graph
 * In the metadata tab there should be task panes similar to the result window, that can be opened and closed so that the user can either watch the current \"column metadata table\" or the new graph or both.
 * It would also be very cool if the user could use the graph to select tables and columns for the profiler or validator and for previewing.
 * Right-clicking on a relationship could bring up a \"preview joined\" option where the tables at the ends of the relationship are joined and previewed. Perhaps this idea could also expand to doing some simple metrics/profiling of the relationship.",kasper

 * String toRegex(String pattern);

The syntax for pattern finder's patterns is very simple:

 * words are denoted using a's
 * numbers are denoted as 9's
 * mixed words (for example windows95) is denoted as ?'s
